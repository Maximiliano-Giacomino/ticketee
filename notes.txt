Our project should achieve the following tasks:
• Track tickets (of course) and group them into projects
• Provide a way to restrict users to certain projects
• Allow users to upload files to tickets
• Let users tag tickets so they’re easy to find
• Provide an API on which users can base development of their own applications
It was started using "rails new ticketee -c sass"
