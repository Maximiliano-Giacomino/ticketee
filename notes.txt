Our project should achieve the following tasks:
• Track tickets (of course) and group them into projects
• Provide a way to restrict users to certain projects
• Allow users to upload files to tickets
• Let users tag tickets so they’re easy to find
• Provide an API on which users can base development of their own applications
It was started using "rails new ticketee -c sass". We then install some extra gems (byebug, rspec and webdrivers) using "bundle install". 
In order to start up rspec we need to run "rails g rspec:install". This adds the /spec folder where our tests shall go.
